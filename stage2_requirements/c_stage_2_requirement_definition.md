# Scenarios


## Scenario 1: Sofia wants to use more efficient study methods

Sofia is very competitive in school and always loved studying. She is finding that after she started university her grades are dropping a little, but especially that the time she needs to study is making her daily routing very hard.  
She decided to use the new app, she discovered from a friend, to make her study more efficient.  

It is the first day in new semester.
Her first class of the day is on Biology.  
The professor began the class by outlining the key dates for the two tests of the class and the deadline for delivery of a final project. Sofia immediately opens the app's calendar and marks these dates.

As the class progresses the professor introduces the first topic on biology.
Sofia opens a new notes document and writes down some important things. She realizes that she is way quicker writing on her notebook than with a pen and paper.

When Sofia gets home she wants to go over the lectured topic.
The professor made the lecture slides available so she uploads them to the app. The app suggests to generates a quizz using AI. She generates the quizz and takes it to address what she learned.  
Sofia gets instant feedback on her quizz answers and bookmarks topics she realizes she needs to go over again.

Sofia feels very confident with what she learned using this new study method. She also ends up finishing her study much faster, so she has time to watch her favorite tv-show which boosts her motivation.  

## Scenario 2: Lucas Trying to Overcome Procrastination

[Lucas had always wanted to study consistently but struggled with procrastination. He would get distracted by social media and games, leaving things to the last minute. Today, he decided to try a study management app that promised to help him stay organized and focused.]

[When he opened the app for the first time, Lucas answered a few questions about the subjects he needed to study, his available time, and his biggest difficulties. The system, understanding his challenges with focus and time management, created a personalized study schedule tailored to his needs.]

[Motivated, Lucas began his first study session. As the study timer started, the app sent him a notification reminding him to start his session. He turned on focus mode, blocking social media apps that usually distracted him.]

[After a 25-minute study block, the app vibrated slightlyâ€”a signal that the session was over. A quick challenge popped up on the screen, asking him to solve an exercise based on what he had just studied. Lucas accepted and completed the challenge, earning points for his effort.]

[As he continued using the app, Lucas bookmarked key concepts he found difficult, leaving short notes for future review. The system, recognizing his engagement, suggested additional exercises and adjusted his study plan accordingly.]

[Halfway through his study session, the app offered him a short quiz to test his knowledge and help reinforce the material. Lucas took the quiz, reflecting on his progress and feeling more confident in his studies.]
