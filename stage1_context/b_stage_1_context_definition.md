# B. Stage 1 - Context Definition


# B.1. Competitor Identification
>	The competitor analysis will entail an identification of all competitors, with brief descriptions and a collection of the look and feel of their solutions, e.g., with screenshots, etc. It will also include a detailed analysis of the competitor deemed the best or more representative. It ends with a summary of the main findings including an HCI SWOT analysis



## B.1a. Competitors

## B.1b. Detailed Competitor Analysis
>	Choose the most notable competitor and do a more thorough analysis of their interactive solution


### - Heuristic Evaluation

#### Method
<!--[ Describe the method used for the heuristic evaluation: procedure, number of experts, heuristics, severity scale considered, how was consensus done.]-->

The heuristic evaluation followed the Nielsen Norman Group model to assess the usability of **RemNote**.  

#### Procedure  
- Three experts independently analyzed the application.  
- Each identified issue was classified based on usability heuristics and a severity scale.  
- Results were compared and consolidated into a consensus table.  

#### Evaluated Heuristics  
The evaluation was based on **Nielsenâ€™s 10 usability heuristics**:  
- Visibility of system status  
- Match between system and the real world  
- User control and freedom  
- Consistency and standards  
- Error prevention  
- Recognition rather than recall  
- Flexibility and efficiency of use  
- Aesthetic and minimalist design  
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors  
- Help and documentation  

#### Severity Scale  
Issues were classified on a **1 to 5 severity scale**:  
- **1 (Cosmetic):** No significant impact.  
- **2 (Minor):** Small issue but does not prevent normal usage.  
- **3 (Major):** Significant usability problem that affects the user experience.  
- **4 (Severe):** Seriously hinders usability and requires urgent attention.  
- **5 (Catastrophic):** Prevents task completion and demands immediate action.  

#### Consensus Process  
- Experts compared findings and consolidated issues into a shared table.  
- Discrepancies were discussed to assign a final severity rating.  
- If an issue was reported by only one expert, the other reviewed the interface to confirm it.  

#### Individual Evaluations
<!-- For the individual heuristic evaluations by each member of the group, you can use the templates below, grouping problems by heuristic OR each evaluator can have a table listing all the detected problems with the number of the violated heuristics on the second column. Whichever your choice, you should have a list of problems, the severity, and a recommendation to mitigate it -->

- [expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)

- [expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)


#### Consensus

>	After the individual analysis by each expert, all results should be gathered in a consensus table. If an expert has not found any of the problems found by other experts, they should analyse it, at this point, and give it a severity.

| **Issue**       | **Expert 1** | Expert 2 | Expert 3 | Recommendations                             |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Something wrong | 3            | 1        | 0        | Something could be done to the button to... |
| Another thing   | 4            | 3        | 4        | Other thing to recommend                    |
| ...             |              |          |          |                                             |

## B.1c. Overall Analysis

[Here, you should summarize the main findings for the competitor panorama, listing key points that are valuable to inform the design of your solution, and also make an HCI SWOT analysis for the main competitor, taking into consideration what you learned from the heuristic evaluatio, cognitive walkthrough, online reviews, user feedback, etc.]

- RemNote has strong learning tools (spaced repetition, flashcards) but suffers from complex navigation, slow sync, and cluttered UI. Improving feedback, simplifying menus, and adding shortcuts can enhance usability and competitiveness.

# B.2. Users
>	For the users, there are two goals: 1) understand the current status of users in the domain you are addressing. How do they manage, what are the main tasks they do, if they use some tool for the purpose, what are current challenges, what might be improved, what might be new features, ...

## B.2a. Method

[What approach was followed to talk with users; what kind of users were considered. What was the goal of the interviews? What were the questions considered?]

We conducted interviews in class and outside questioning our target audience: students. The goal of this interviews was to contextualize ourselves of the opinions and needs of students near us and start to gather information on the best features that a study manager needs to have.

The questions were:
- How do you currently organize your studies?
- What tools or methods do you use?
- What is the biggest challenge in managing your studies?
- What most affects your productivity?
- What features should a good study manager have?
- Would you prefer a more automated system (e.g., schedule suggestions) or a more customizable one?
- How do you imagine the ideal interface for a study manager?
- Would you use it more on a computer or on a mobile device?
- How do you track your study progress?
- Do you find notifications and reminders useful?

## B.2b. Results
